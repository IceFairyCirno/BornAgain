## Native Android App for Fitness Record

> This isn't the final version yet, but functional for daily record.

Developed just for myself, posting it just to show off my shitty skills.

Feel free to give comments through my website, and don't complain about the UI design. I am not a UI/UX designer.

Functions are 60% Vibe-Coded, Layouts are 5% Vibe-Coded.

0 cybersecurity, I don't think someone will be interested in my body weight.

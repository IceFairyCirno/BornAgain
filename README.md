## Native Android App for Fitness Record

> This isn't the final version yet, but functional for daily records.

Developed just for myself, posting it just to show off my shitty skills.

Feel free to give comments through [my website](https://icefairycirno.github.io/My-Website/), and don't complain about the UI design. I am not a UI/UX designer.

Functions are 70% Vibe-Coded, Layouts are 5% Vibe-Coded.

0 cybersecurity, I don't think someone will be interested in my body weight.
